# Lockdiff

Convert a lock with lots of info to something more readable

For instance:

```toml
[[package]]
name = "foo"
version = "1.4"
```

becomes:

```
foo@1.4
```

# Using lockdiff with git

The primary purpose of this tool is to hide "noise" related to package changes
in automatically generated files such as `Cargo.lock` when using with `git diff`
and related commands.

For this to work, you need to register the 'lockdiff' in .gitattributes:

```
Cargo.lock diff=lockdiff
```

And have the following section in your git config:

```ini
[diff "lockdiff"]
textconv = lockdiff
```

# Supported locks

* `Cargo.lock`
* `poetry.lock` (fun fact, Poetry and Cargo have compatible formats ðŸ˜Ž)
* `package-lock.json`
* `yarn.lock`
